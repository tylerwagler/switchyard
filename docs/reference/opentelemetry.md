# OpenTelemetry

Reference for the spans, attributes, and metrics emitted by libsy and its LLM client.

## Host setup

Your application installs a `tracing-opentelemetry` subscriber and global OTel meter
provider, and owns exporters, filtering, sampling, context propagation, and flushing.
Libsy installs none of these and sends no telemetry itself. Environment variables
alone do not enable collection. See [OTel Rust setup](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/rust/)
and [OTLP configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/).

## Spans and attributes

| Span | Emitted by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `libsy.run` | Libsy | One algorithm run, including routing-time work. OpenInference kind `CHAIN`. |
| `libsy.llm_call` | Libsy driver | Waiting for the host to fulfill an offloaded call. Includes host queueing. OpenInference kind `CHAIN`. |
| `libsy.client_call`, exported as `chat <model_id>` | LLM client driver | One candidate model call, including that candidate's retries. OTel kind `CLIENT`; OpenInference kind `LLM`. |

Hosts driving `run_stream` without the LLM client driver instrument their own model I/O.

### Routing outcome fields

On `libsy.run`:

| Attribute | Type | Meaning / presence |
|---|---|---|
| `algorithm`, `switchyard.algorithm` | string | Name from `Algorithm::name()`. |
| `switchyard.route` | string | Inbound request model/route, when present. |
| `outcome` | string | `ok` or `error` when the algorithm task resolves. |
| `outcome_id` | string | Successful outcome's ID. `OutcomeMetadata::new` generates a UUIDv7. |
| `selected_model_ids` | string array | Successful outcome's selected model followed by ordered fallbacks. This is a plan, not proof that every model was called. |
| `session_id`, `session.id` | string | Request session ID, when supplied. Both names carry the same value. |
| `agent_id`, `task_id`, `task_kind`, `agent_role`, `correlation_id` | string | Corresponding request metadata, when supplied. |
| `evidence.source`, `evidence.verdict`, `evidence.trigger`, `evidence.reason_code` | string | Known string fields from outcome evidence, when present. |
| `evidence.score`, `evidence.confidence`, `evidence.threshold` | number | Known numeric fields from outcome evidence, when present. |

`RoutingOutcome.metadata` is available in Rust and Python. Its optional JSON evidence
exports only the listed keys with matching types; unknown keys and wrong types are
omitted. Evidence may be absent. Scores and confidence have algorithm-specific meanings.
Failed runs return typed errors, not outcome metadata; successful fail-open decisions
may carry a fixed `reason_code`.

### Model-call fields

The LLM client driver records these on `libsy.client_call`:

| Attribute | Type | Meaning / presence |
|---|---|---|
| `algorithm`, `switchyard.algorithm`, `selected_model` | string | Algorithm and candidate model ID. |
| `switchyard.candidate`, `switchyard.candidate_count` | integer | One-based candidate position and number of candidates. |
| `gen_ai.operation.name` | string | `chat`. |
| `gen_ai.request.model` | string | Requested model; the translating client records the upstream model name. |
| `gen_ai.request.stream` | boolean | Recorded as `true` for streaming requests; otherwise omitted. |
| `gen_ai.request.temperature`, `gen_ai.request.top_p` | number | Sampling values represented in the request IR, when set. |
| `gen_ai.request.top_k`, `gen_ai.request.max_tokens` | integer | Sampling/output limits, when set. |
| `gen_ai.request.reasoning.level`, `gen_ai.output.type` | string | Reasoning effort and recognized output type (`text` or `json`), when set. |
| `gen_ai.conversation.id` | string | Request session ID, when supplied. |
| `server.address`, `server.port` | string, integer | Upstream host and port, recorded by the translating client. |
| `gen_ai.response.id`, `gen_ai.response.model` | string | Values supplied by the upstream response. |
| `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons` | string array | Available normalized stop reasons. |
| `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` | integer | Input tokens including cache reads and cache creation. |
| `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` | integer | Output tokens. |
| `gen_ai.usage.cache_read.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.cache_creation.input_tokens` | integer | Cache-read and cache-creation input tokens. |
| `gen_ai.usage.reasoning.output_tokens` | integer | Reasoning output tokens. |
| `outcome` | string | `ok`, `error`, or `cancelled`. |
| `error.type`, `error` | string | Failure category/status and error description on this client span. |

`gen_ai.provider.name` is intentionally unset: an endpoint or model name does not
reliably identify the provider. Usage fields are omitted when unavailable, not
invented as zero. Available counts are capped at OTel's signed integer maximum.

## Metrics

Metrics use the `switchyard` meter scope. The tables use OTel instrument names.

### Routing and client metrics

| Instrument | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `switchyard.runs` | Counter | `algorithm`, `outcome` | Completed algorithm tasks, including failures. |
| `switchyard.run_duration_ms` | Histogram | `algorithm`, `outcome` | Algorithm-task duration in milliseconds. |
| `switchyard.algorithms_in_flight` | UpDownCounter | `algorithm` | Active algorithm tasks; exported as a Prometheus gauge. |
| `switchyard.decisions` | Counter | `algorithm`, `selected_model` | Published routing decisions. |
| `switchyard.llm_calls` | Counter | `algorithm`, `selected_model`, `outcome` | Routing-time offloaded calls and each terminal answer candidate, including failures. |
| `switchyard.llm_call_duration_ms` | Histogram | `algorithm`, `selected_model`, `outcome` | One duration sample in milliseconds per offloaded call or terminal answer candidate, including failures; see streaming limits below. |
| `switchyard.total_requests` | ObservableGauge | none | Process-wide total of successful and failed answer candidates after routing, including reused routing responses. |
| `switchyard.total_errors` | ObservableGauge | none | Process-wide total of failures after routing, including failed answer candidates and reused routing responses. |
| `switchyard.requests` | Counter | `model` | Successful answer candidates or reused routing responses, by model ID. |
| `switchyard.errors` | Counter | `model` | Failed answer candidates or reused routing responses, by model ID. |
| `switchyard.model_call_latency_ms` | Histogram | `model` | Successful answer-candidate duration in milliseconds, including that candidate's retries and stream consumption. Excludes routing time and reused routing responses. |
| `switchyard.routing_overhead_ms` | Histogram | `algorithm` | LLM client driver's time to obtain a successful routing outcome, including judge calls but excluding any subsequent answer call. |
| `switchyard.classifier_fail_open` | Counter | `judge_model`, `reason` | Judge failures that caused classification to proceed without a verdict. |
| `switchyard.upstream_attempts` | Counter | `outcome`, `code` | HTTP attempts, including retries, made by the translating client. |
| `switchyard.router_retry_recovered` | Counter | none | Upstream operations that succeeded after a retry. |

Algorithm/call `outcome` is `ok` or `error`. HTTP attempt `outcome` is `ok` for
2xx, `retryable_error` for 408/429/5xx or failures without a status, and
`other_error` otherwise. `code` is an allowlisted status, a status-class bucket,
or `none`. Classifier `reason` is `timeout`, `transport`, `upstream_5xx`,
`upstream_non_5xx`, `invalid_response`, `parse_error`, `client_error`, or `call_error`.

Client requests, routing decisions, model calls, and HTTP attempts have separate
counts. For `switchyard.llm_calls` and `switchyard.llm_call_duration_ms`, each
routing-time offloaded call and each terminal answer candidate contributes one
observation. HTTP retries stay within the same candidate's count and duration.
Reusing a response produced during routing keeps only its routing-time call observation.

For example, one buffered client request with no judge calls or retries, a failed
primary, and a successful fallback produces one client response, one routing decision,
two `llm_calls`, and two `llm_call_duration_ms` samples. The primary has
`selected_model=<primary>` and `outcome=error`; the fallback has
`selected_model=<fallback>` and `outcome=ok`. For terminal answer-candidate observations,
`selected_model` identifies the model called. For routing-time observations, it
identifies the initial routing candidate. For `switchyard.decisions`, it identifies
the initial routing selection.

The five request/error/latency instruments above record each answer candidate after
routing, not each HTTP attempt. A failed candidate followed by a successful fallback
adds two to `total_requests`, one to `total_errors`, one to `errors` for the failed
model, and one to `requests` for the successful model. Routing-time calls and failures
before a routing outcome do not contribute. A response reused from routing contributes
one to `total_requests` and one to either `requests` or `errors` (also `total_errors`
on failure), but no `model_call_latency_ms` sample. The `model` label is the
candidate's configured model ID (the serving model for a reused response).
For terminal answer candidates, it matches `selected_model` on `llm_calls` and
`llm_call_duration_ms`. The two total gauges are cumulative process-wide
compatibility values.

For streams, these five instruments record when the response stream ends or is dropped.
Stream errors count as failures. Dropping an unfinished stream also counts as a failure;
a terminal message permits a successful drop. Failed calls have no
`model_call_latency_ms` sample.

### Algorithm-specific metrics

Stage Router instruments use the prefix `switchyard.stage_router.`:

| Suffix | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `routing_decisions` | Counter | `decision_source`, `target_name` | Choices by decision source and semantic target name. |
| `probability` | Histogram | none | Scorer's capable-model probability. |
| `confidence` | Histogram | none | Confidence used to resolve or defer a turn. |
| `severity` | Histogram | none | Tool-failure severity. |
| `spinning` | Histogram | none | Repeated unproductive tool activity. |
| `exploring` | Histogram | none | Exploratory tool activity. |
| `production_intensity` | Histogram | none | Production-oriented tool activity. |

These histograms contain unitless values from 0 to 1. They are recorded when tool
signals reach the scorer, including when it defers to a classifier. They are not
one sample per application request and are not split by route or session.

Advisor Gate instruments use the prefix `switchyard.advisor_gate.`:

| Suffix | Type | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reviews` | Counter | `verdict`, `trigger` | Review outcomes and what triggered them. |
| `consult_failures` | Counter | `reason` | Failed advisor consultations. |
| `discarded_turns` | Counter | none | Executor turns discarded after a redo verdict. |
| `discarded_tokens` | Counter | `kind` | Tokens in discarded turns; `kind` is `input`, `cached`, `cache_creation`, or `output`. |

## Limits

### Timing and streaming

- `libsy.run` may finish before the answer call. Nested algorithms have separate run spans.
- `libsy.llm_call` and routing-time call metrics end when the host fulfills the offloaded call. They include host queueing. The LLM client driver buffers routing streams before fulfilling the call. The span's `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `total_tokens`, and `reasoning_tokens` fields are buffered-response only.
- For terminal answer candidates, `switchyard.llm_calls` and `switchyard.llm_call_duration_ms` record when the response stream ends or is dropped. Duration includes that candidate's retries and stream consumption. Stream errors and unfinished drops record `outcome=error`; a terminal message permits a successful drop.
- `libsy.client_call` remains open while its stream is consumed. IDs, usage, and finish reasons update from normalized events. An unfinished stream dropped by its consumer records `cancelled`; a stream error records `error`.

### Data exposure

Built-in evidence excludes prompts, responses, and raw errors. Custom evidence is
checked for field names and types, not string contents or lengths. Client spans may
include error descriptions and upstream addresses; algorithm logs may include content
such as Advisor Gate's `reply_head`. Supplied session/correlation IDs are included.
Review collected data before exporting it outside your deployment.

Custom algorithms can record OTel instruments directly. Keep metric labels to
configured names and fixed categories, not request/session IDs or user text.

### Source and stability

These are current implementation names, not a separately versioned telemetry schema.
Debug spans and log events are not a stable field contract.
