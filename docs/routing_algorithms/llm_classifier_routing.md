# LLM Classifier Routing

LLM classifier routing supports capability classification, trajectory escalation,
and custom schema-driven routing across two or more targets.

## Configure a classifier route

This example uses the packaged classifier prompt as intended: it estimates
whether the weak target can complete the task, and keeps the first routing
decision for later requests in the same conversation.

```toml
schema_version = 1

[llm_clients.openrouter]
format = "openai_chat"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
api_key_env = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

[targets.classifier]
id = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
llm_client = "openrouter"

[targets.strong]
id = "openai/gpt-4o"
llm_client = "openrouter"

[targets.weak]
id = "z-ai/glm-5.2"
llm_client = "openrouter"

[routes.smart]
id = "smart"
type = "llm_classifier"
mode = "capability"
classifier_target = "classifier"
strong_target = "strong"
weak_target = "weak"
base_threshold = 0.5
threshold_step = 0.1
classify_trigger = "new_session"
message_hash_fallback = true
```

`message_hash_fallback` is best-effort: independent sessions with the same
first user message share an affinity key. Prefer an explicit
`x-switchyard-session-id` when repeated opening prompts are possible.

The target table names are local references. Their `id` values are the model
identifiers sent to the upstream provider. The route's `id`, `smart`, is the
model name clients send to Switchyard.

## How the decision works

The classifier target returns a structured verdict containing:

- `p_solve`: the estimated probability that the weak model completes the task.
- `capability_boundary`: `supported`, `uncertain`, `unsupported`, or `unmatched`.
- `primary_rule`: the capability-card rule that determines the boundary.
- `crux`: the hardest material requirement for whole-task success.

For a usable verdict, Switchyard routes to `weak_target` when `p_solve` is
greater than or equal to the applicable threshold. Otherwise it routes to
`strong_target`:

- `supported` uses `base_threshold`.
- `uncertain` and `unmatched` use `base_threshold + threshold_step`.
- `unsupported` uses `base_threshold + 2 * threshold_step`.

An invalid, inconsistent, or unparseable verdict, or a judge failure, routes to
`strong_target`. Raising either knob sends more traffic to the strong model.

## Judge model compatibility

The judge must return complete, schema-valid JSON in normal assistant `content`.
Switchyard does not parse provider-specific reasoning fields such as
`reasoning_content`. If `content` is empty or unparseable, the route falls back
to `strong_target` even when the judge request returned HTTP 200. With session
affinity, that fallback can be reused without another judge call.

Capability and escalation routes use JSON Schema structured output by default.
For a provider that supports JSON Object mode but not JSON Schema, set
`response_format_type = "json_object"` on the route. Switchyard then adds the
verdict schema to the judge prompt and validates the returned object locally.

When a vLLM-compatible provider supports `enable_thinking`, configure it on the
judge target through `extra_body`:

```toml
[targets.classifier]
extra_body = { chat_template_kwargs = { enable_thinking = false } }
```

`enable_thinking` is a provider-specific vLLM option, not a general requirement
for reasoning models. Other model/provider pairs may work with reasoning enabled
or use a different control. Verify the judge response shape before deployment.
If reasoning remains enabled, set `max_output_tokens` high enough for both the
reasoning and final JSON. A truncated verdict has the same fail-open result. See
the [target-level `extra_body` reference](../../crates/switchyard-server/CONFIGURATION.md#add-an-llm-client-and-target)
for the server merge behavior.

## Tuning options

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `base_threshold` | required | Lowest `p_solve` that routes a supported task to `weak_target`. Must be between `0` and `1`. |
| `threshold_step` | `0.0` | Amount added for each boundary step. Must be finite and non-negative, and `base_threshold + 2 * threshold_step` must not exceed `1`. |
| `recent_turn_window` | unset | When unset, the judge sees the opening user task and the latest user message when they differ. When set to `N`, it sees the opening user task and the last `N` conversation messages after that task. `0` keeps only the opening task. Client system and developer instructions are not shown to the judge. |
| `classify_trigger` | `every_request` | When the judge runs. `every_request` judges every request, tool continuations included. `user_turn` judges each new user message and holds that target across the tool calls between. `new_session` judges once and reuses that target for the session. |
| `message_hash_fallback` | `false` | When session metadata is absent, keys affinity from the first user-message text. Requires `classify_trigger = "new_session"`. |
| `prompt` | packaged capability prompt | Replaces the classifier's system prompt. The packaged verdict schema and routing policy remain active. |
| `response_format_type` | `json_schema` | Structured-output mode for capability and escalation judges. Use `json_object` for providers without JSON Schema support. |
| `max_output_tokens` | `4096` | Maximum completion tokens available to the classifier verdict. Must be at least `1`. |

### Override the classifier prompt

Set `prompt` on the route when the packaged capability rubric does not describe
your weak model. Do not copy the response schema into the prompt: Switchyard
supplies it according to `response_format_type`.

```toml
[routes.smart]
id = "smart"
type = "llm_classifier"
mode = "capability"
classifier_target = "classifier"
strong_target = "strong"
weak_target = "weak"
base_threshold = 0.5
prompt = """
Estimate whether the weak target can complete the request.
Return exactly one JSON object matching the response schema supplied with the request.
"""
```

The override changes the instructions only. The judge must still return the
packaged `crux`, `primary_rule`, `capability_boundary`, and `p_solve` fields.

## Custom multi-target routing

Custom mode accepts an inner JSON Schema and a policy that reads the validated
verdict. The policy selects one of the route's model groups, and you name those
groups yourself, so a route can choose between as many models as you like.

```toml
[routes.smart]
id = "smart"
type = "llm_classifier"
mode = "custom"
default_target = "premium"
prompt = """
Choose the best group for this request.
Return JSON matching the response schema supplied with the request.
"""
response_schema = '''
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "decision": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "target": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["fast", "balanced", "reasoning", "premium"]
        }
      },
      "required": ["target"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  },
  "required": ["decision"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
'''

[routes.smart.models]
judge = ["classifier"]
fast = ["fast"]
balanced = ["balanced"]
reasoning = ["reasoning", "premium"]
premium = ["premium"]
any = ["fast", "balanced", "reasoning", "premium"]

[routes.smart.policy]
type = "target_selector"
selector = "/decision/target"
```

The names in `models` reference existing target tables. Switchyard passes the
schema to the provider in a strict structured-output wrapper and validates the
returned JSON again. `jsonptr` resolves the selector against that verdict. A
missing, non-string, or unconfigured label falls back to `default_target`, and
`judge` is never routable.

A verdict names a group, and the **first** model in that group serves the turn.
Later entries are that group's own fallbacks: if the serving call fails, the
client falls through the rest of the chosen group first — `reasoning` retries on
`premium` above — and then through whatever `models.any` adds. Every group's
targets must also appear in `models.any`; one that does not is rejected when the
configuration loads. `models.judge` supplies the judge call's own candidates in
order and is not a completion destination.

`capable` and `efficient` are reserved names. Use them when you want a group to
carry the tier meaning the stage and composite routers give it; otherwise any
name works.

This separation applies to every classifier mode. Prompts containing the legacy
`{{RESPONSE_SCHEMA}}` placeholder are rejected during configuration validation.

### Forecast and policy assumptions

The packaged prompt forecasts whole-task success for a generic efficient agent.
It produces a probability and capability boundary but does not choose a route.
The deterministic policy applies `base_threshold` and `threshold_step` after
generation.

Without affinity, the runtime judges every request. By default, it sends the
opening task and the latest user follow-up when they differ. Set
`recent_turn_window` when intervening conversation context affects the forecast.
If a client sends only a follow-up fragment without the opening task, enable
affinity or include the task history. Threshold tuning changes routing policy;
it cannot recover missing task context.

## When the judge runs

`classify_trigger` sets how often the target is re-decided.

`every_request`, the default, judges every request. In an agentic session that
includes every tool continuation, so twenty tool steps means twenty-one
classifications of one task, and the target can change between any two of them.

`user_turn` judges each new user message and holds that target through the tool
calls that follow:

```toml
[routes.smart]
classify_trigger = "user_turn"
```

Tool results are the agent continuing work the user already asked for, so they
do not re-open the decision. A failed or unusable verdict keeps the current
target. When no target has been selected yet, the next request is judged again.

`new_session` judges once and reuses that target for the rest of the session,
including `strong_target` when it was selected as the fallback for an unusable
verdict. There is no warmup period, and later requests skip the judge entirely.

The selection is held in per-session state, so requests without a session
identity are judged every time. Clients can send `x-switchyard-session-id`, or
enable `message_hash_fallback` to key on the first user-message text under
`new_session`.

## Run the route

After [installing the Rust server](../getting_started.md#install-the-server), export
the provider credential, validate the configuration, and start the release
binary:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-key"  # pragma: allowlist secret
switchyard-server --config routes.toml --dry-run
switchyard-server --config routes.toml \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000
```

Send a request using the route ID:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"smart","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Explain why the sky appears blue."}]}'
```

Treat the selected target as model-dependent output, not a fixed test result.
