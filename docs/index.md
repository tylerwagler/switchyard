# Switchyard

Switchyard routes and translates LLM traffic for coding agents and API clients.
It supports OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic Messages.

## Choose a Path

| Goal | Path | Start here |
|---|---|---|
| Run Switchyard as a standalone proxy for API clients | Server Path | [Build and run the Rust server](getting_started.md#server-path) |
| Add Switchyard routing to a Rust application | Library Path | [`switchyard-libsy`](../crates/libsy/README.md) |
| Add Switchyard routing to NeMo Relay | Native Plugin Path | [Use Switchyard with NeMo Relay](integrations/nemo_relay.md) |

The Server Path builds and runs the standalone `switchyard-server` binary.
