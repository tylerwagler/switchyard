# Getting Started with Switchyard

Switchyard has two native Rust execution paths:

- **Server path:** build and run the standalone Rust server for API clients and
  custom deployments.
- **Library path:** embed the routing algorithms directly in your own Rust
  application with `switchyard-libsy`.

## Server Path

Use this path when you want a standalone proxy for API clients or need to
operate the Rust server directly.

### Prerequisites

- Git, a native build toolchain, and Rust with Cargo
- An API key for OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, or another OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
  To use OpenRouter, create an account at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
  and generate a key from the [OpenRouter keys page](https://openrouter.ai/keys).

On Ubuntu or WSL, install the build prerequisites and Rust with `rustup`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential curl git
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

On macOS or native Windows, follow the
[official Rust installation instructions](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/).
The Rust installer includes `rustc`, Cargo, and `rustup`.

Install `uv` for the repository's Python-based tooling and CI checks. It is not
required to build or run the Rust server:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

If either installer updates your shell configuration, restart the shell before
continuing. Verify the tools:

```bash
git --version
rustc --version
cargo --version
uv --version
```

### Install the server

Install the Rust server from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install --locked switchyard-server
switchyard-server --help
```

Cargo builds the release binary and installs it into `~/.cargo/bin` by default.

### Configure

The Rust server reads an explicit TOML file.

Create `routes.toml` with an auto route:

```toml
schema_version = 1

[llm_clients.openrouter]
format = "openai_chat"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
api_key_env = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

[targets.weak]
id = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
llm_client = "openrouter"

[targets.strong]
id = "openai/gpt-4o"
llm_client = "openrouter"

[routes.smart]
id = "switchyard"
type = "auto"
capable_target = "strong"
efficient_target = "weak"
```

`format` selects the upstream protocol and must be `openai_chat`,
`openai_responses`, or `anthropic_messages`. `api_key_env` names the environment
variable the server reads; the secret does not belong in the TOML file.
A client can set `forward_auth = true` instead of `api_key_env` to send each
caller's credential to that upstream. OpenAI clients forward `authorization`,
`chatgpt-account-id`, and `x-openai-fedramp`. Anthropic clients forward
`authorization` or `x-api-key`. Enable this only for an upstream that should
receive the caller's login. The server rejects a forwarding route called
through the other provider's API.

### Run the server

Export the provider credential, validate the configuration without binding a
socket, then start the release binary:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-key"  # pragma: allowlist secret
switchyard-server --config routes.toml --dry-run
switchyard-server --config routes.toml \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000
```

Any client that speaks OpenAI Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, or OpenAI
Responses API can connect. The route `id` is the model name clients use.

In another terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/models
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"switchyard","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

### Routing algorithms

#### Choose a route type

This guide uses `auto`, which routes with Switchyard's recommended default
settings. The Rust server also supports:

| Algorithm | Use it when | Config |
|---|---|---|
| Auto | You want a recommended default instead of picking a strategy yourself. | `auto` |
| [Random](routing_algorithms/random_routing.md) | You need a weighted split for A/B tests or baselines. | `random` |
| [LLM classifier](routing_algorithms/llm_classifier_routing.md) | Request content should decide whether to use the weak or strong target. | `llm_classifier` |
| [Stage router](routing_algorithms/stage_router_routing.md) | Built-in or configured tool-activity signals should select an efficient or capable target. | `stage_router` |

A single TOML file can declare multiple routes. The table key, such as
`routes.smart`, is a local configuration name; each route's `id` is exposed as a
model on `GET /v1/models`.

See [Routing Overview](routing_algorithms/overview.md) to compare strategies,
and the [`switchyard-server` guide](../crates/switchyard-server/README.md) for
the complete TOML schema, route options, TLS, and metrics.

### Troubleshooting

**No API key / auth error**

```bash
test -n "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY" && echo "key is set" || echo "key is missing"
switchyard-server --config routes.toml --dry-run
```

Confirm that `api_key_env` in `routes.toml` names the environment variable you
exported. The dry run validates the schema, environment lookup, target
references, and route construction without starting the server.

**Connection refused**

Check health: `curl http://localhost:4000/health`

**Telemetry header**

Switchyard documents an `X-Switchyard-Version` header for release attribution
on outbound LLM calls. No request or response content is included. The 0.2.0
native server does not currently send this header upstream (see
[Known Issues](known_issues.md)), so no opt-out is required at the moment.

---

## Library Path

Use this path when you want routing inside your own Rust application rather than
behind a proxy. `switchyard-libsy` never calls a model itself: an algorithm
picks a target and hands the model call back to you.

### Add the dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
async-trait = "0.1"
futures = "0.3"
switchyard-libsy = { git = "https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Switchyard.git", tag = "v0.2.0" }
switchyard-protocol = { git = "https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Switchyard.git", tag = "v0.2.0" }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt"] }
```

### Choose an algorithm

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LlmTaskClassifier` | Ask a judge model to choose an efficient or capable target. |
| `StageRouter` | Route from signals already in the conversation, such as tool results and errors, with an optional judge fallback. |
| `LlmTaskClassifier` with escalation | Every turn runs on the efficient target first, and a judge reads that answer to decide whether to send the same request to the capable target. |
| `Random` | Select among any number of targets, uniform or weighted. |

These are the same strategies the server exposes as route types, so a deployment
can move between the server and library paths without changing routing
behaviour.

### Drive the algorithm

An algorithm yields a stream of steps. Each `Step::CallModel` is a routing-time classifier or
judge call your host performs over its own transport. The run ends with `Step::Done` carrying a
`RoutingOutcome`: the selected model, ordered fallbacks, rewritten request, and an optional
response when routing already produced the answer. Otherwise the host makes the terminal answer
call from that outcome. Serving these calls yourself is what lets libsy embed in a host that
already owns its HTTP stack, retries, and credentials.

Successful runs also include `OutcomeMetadata`: a unique `outcome_id`, the algorithm
name, and optional JSON evidence. In Python, read `outcome.metadata.outcome_id`,
`outcome.metadata.algorithm`, and `outcome.metadata.evidence` after checking that
`outcome.metadata` is present. Evidence is a normal Python value, usually a dictionary;
algorithms without evidence return `None`.

With a host-installed OpenTelemetry subscriber, the existing `libsy.run` span records
the same identity, selected models, and supported evidence fields. See
the [OpenTelemetry reference](reference/opentelemetry.md) for field names, metrics,
and export setup. libsy does not install an exporter or send telemetry itself.

For the request, response, and streaming types the steps carry, see
[`switchyard-protocol`](../crates/protocol/README.md).
